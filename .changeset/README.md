# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`.

## Adding a changeset

When you make a change that should be released, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select the packages that have changed
2. Choose the type of change (patch, minor, major)
3. Write a summary of the changes

A new markdown file will be created in this folder describing the change.

## What happens next?

When your PR is merged to `main`:

1. The **Release** workflow detects the changeset files
2. It creates a "Version Packages" PR with:
   - Updated `package.json` versions
   - Generated `CHANGELOG.md` entries
3. When that PR is merged, packages are published automatically

## Changeset types

- **patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, documentation updates
- **minor** (0.X.0): New features, non-breaking changes  
- **major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes
